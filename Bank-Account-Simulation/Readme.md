# Simple Bank Account Simulation

This is a small Java console app that simulates basic bank operations like depositing money, withdrawing, checking balance, and applying interest.

## Functions

- Created an `Account` class to handle deposits, withdrawals, and track balance.
- Created a `SavingsAccount` class that adds interest to the account (inherits from `Account`).
- Built a console menu in the `Main` class so users can interact with the app.
- Used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like:
  - Classes & Objects
  - Inheritance
  - Method Overriding
  - Encapsulation
